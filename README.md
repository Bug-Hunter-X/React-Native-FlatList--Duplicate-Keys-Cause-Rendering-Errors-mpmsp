# React Native FlatList: Duplicate Keys Cause Rendering Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component: using duplicate keys for items in the data array. Duplicate keys cause unexpected rendering behavior, such as missing items or items appearing in the wrong order.

## Problem
The `FlatList` component relies on unique keys to efficiently update and render its items. When duplicate keys are present, the component cannot reliably track the changes, leading to inconsistent rendering.

## Solution
The solution is straightforward: ensure that each item in the data array has a unique key.  This can be achieved by using a unique identifier, such as a UUID, or by combining multiple properties to create a unique key.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app.
4. Observe the incorrect rendering of the FlatList.
5. Review the `bugSolution.js` file to see how to correct the issue.
