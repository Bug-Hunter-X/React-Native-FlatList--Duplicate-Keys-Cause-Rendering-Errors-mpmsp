This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items with a key that is not unique.  The key prop is essential for FlatList to efficiently update and render items, and duplicate keys can lead to unexpected behavior and rendering issues.  The following code demonstrates this issue:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 2' }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Duplicate IDs cause the problem
/>
```

The `keyExtractor` function uses the `id` property, but the IDs are not unique. This will lead to unpredictable rendering and may cause crashes or unexpected item orderings.
